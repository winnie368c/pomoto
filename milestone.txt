CS193X Final Project Milestone
=============================

Project Name: Pomoto: Pomodoro Timer for Productivity
Your Name: Winnie Chen
Your SUNetID: winniecc

Overview
--------
So far, I have planned out the main page, which is the page displaying the timer and the login button. 
My next steps are to finish the CSS styling on the main page and then write the Javascript for the timer buttons and login. I'm also thinking to have a form where the user inputs what task they plan to work on before starting the timer, and this will be saved to the API as a POST request.
Afterwards, I will need to:
- Write the HTML and CSS for the user analytics page, the page that displays what tasks the user did using the Pomodoro timer
- Write the Javascript for displaying the user analytics page
- Write the API methods 
- Create the backend for above requests

Project Changes
---------------
I added the backend component that allows each user to get a customized analytics page, as described above.

Follow-up
---------
I just had a question regarding using class assignment code - are we only allowed to use what we wrote or can we also use some of the code provided to us in the assignments?
I've found some useful bits of code here and there from files such as EditableText and DynamicList and wasn't sure if I could use them in my project. 

API
---
- POST (posting user tasks to API OR posting inspirational quotes the user enters)
- GET (getting user tasks to display on user analytics page OR getting all the quotes the user entered to display on an "inspiration" page)

External libraries and code
---------------------------
I'm not planning to use any external libraries or code.

Collaboration and resources
---------------------------
I'm planning to only use the assignment code from class. 

Anything else?
-------------
None
